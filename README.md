# Personal website

This repository powers Mirko Amico's professional website. It is a static site built with the Skeleton CSS grid and a layer of custom styling for a polished, modern presentation.

## Local development
- Serve the site locally with any static server, e.g.:
  - `python -m http.server 8000`
  - `npx serve` (if you have Node available)
- Open `http://localhost:8000` (or the reported port) to browse the pages.
- A theme toggle persists your light/dark preference via `localStorage`.

## Testing
No automated tests are configured for this static site. Verify changes by running a local server and reviewing the pages in the browser.
