**Mirko Amico** is a quantum computing researcher at IBM, currently serving as a Technical Lead at IBM Quantum. His work focuses on developing **quantum algorithms** and **quantum control techniques** to harness the power of noisy quantum processors. Mirko has contributed to pioneering experiments in quantum computing – notably the first experimental demonstration of Shor’s factoring algorithm on superconducting qubits:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, and the development of **error-robust quantum gates** using deep reinforcement learning on IBM hardware:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

Mirko’s research interests span **quantum algorithms for optimization and simulation**, **quantum benchmarking and error mitigation**, and **applications of quantum computing to physics and beyond**. He has co-authored numerous publications (see the [Publications](/publications/) page) covering topics such as quantum benchmark best practices, improved quantum error correction strategies, and novel uses of quantum computers for tasks like gravitational-wave signal processing. He is passionate about pushing quantum computing from fundamental research towards practical, real-world impact. Welcome to his academic website!
