### Open-Source Projects and Repositories

- **Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGAN)** – *Qiskit notebooks for quantum state preparation using Generative Adversarial Networks.* This repository contains code demonstrating how to train a quantum GAN to prepare target probability distributions on a quantum simulator:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}. It showcases Mirko’s work in combining quantum algorithms with machine learning techniques. **Repo:** [Quantum_Generative_Adversarial_Networks](https://github.com/miamico/Quantum_Generative_Adversarial_Networks)

- **Dynamical Lamb Effect Simulations** – *Numerical simulations of entanglement dynamics in cavity QED.* Mirko developed Jupyter notebooks to simulate the **dynamical Lamb effect** – the transient generation of entanglement when qubits interact with a non-stationary cavity field:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}. These simulations supported his doctoral research (Phys. Rev. A 2018) and explore fundamental quantum optics phenomena. **Repo:** [dynamical-Lamb-effect](https://github.com/miamico/dynamical-Lamb-effect)

- **IBM "Teach Me Quantum" Challenge** – *Educational notebooks for quantum computing training.* As part of an IBM initiative to teach quantum computing, Mirko contributed a set of tutorial notebooks covering topics like quantum circuits, algorithms, and error mitigation. These materials were used in the “Teach Me Quantum” program to help students and developers learn quantum programming. **Repo:** [IBM-Teach-Me-Quantum](https://github.com/miamico/IBM-Teach-Me-Quantum)

- **Shor’s Algorithm Experiment Code** – *Supporting code for the paper “An Experimental Study of Shor’s Factoring Algorithm on IBM Q.”* This repository contains the code and scripts used to run Shor’s algorithm on actual IBM quantum hardware:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}:contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}. It includes Qiskit implementations of modular exponentiation and quantum Fourier transforms, as well as data analysis from the experiment. **Repo:** [An-Experimental-Study-of-Shor-s-Factoring-Algorithm-on-IBM-Q](https://github.com/miamico/An-Experimental-Study-of-Shor-s-Factoring-Algorithm-on-IBM-Q)
