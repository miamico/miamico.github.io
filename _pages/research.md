### Quantum Algorithms and Applications  
Mirko’s research is centered on developing **quantum algorithms** that can run on today’s quantum hardware. He has worked on algorithms for **quantum factorization** (demonstrating Shor’s algorithm on a superconducting quantum computer:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}) and for **quantum simulation** of many-body physics. His work often involves designing *variational algorithms* and hybrid quantum-classical methods to solve problems in chemistry and physics. Notably, he helped implement algorithms for **quantum eigenvalue estimation** (Krylov and variational approaches) to compute properties of large many-body systems using IBM quantum processors:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. He has also explored applying quantum computing to **real-world data analysis**, for example using qubit-based algorithms for **gravitational-wave signal processing**:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}, showing that quantum techniques can match classical performance on certain tasks.

### Quantum Control and Error Mitigation  
A major theme of Mirko’s work is improving quantum hardware performance through advanced **quantum control**. He has developed methods to create **error-robust quantum gates** without detailed hardware models, using artificial intelligence. In a landmark study, Mirko and colleagues applied **deep reinforcement learning** to autonomously discover microwave pulse shapes that implement quantum logic gates faster and with lower error:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}. These control pulses not only outperformed the default calibrated gates by a factor of two in error reduction, but also remained stable over weeks without recalibration:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. Additionally, Mirko has contributed to strategies for **suppressing correlated noise** in multi-qubit systems, such as **context-aware compiling** techniques that adapt circuit compilation to mitigate crosstalk and coherence losses:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. His research in this area helps extend the effective coherence of quantum processors and improve the reliability of complex circuits.

### Benchmarking 
Mirko is actively involved in **quantum benchmarking** – defining rigorous metrics and tests to evaluate quantum computer performance. He co-authored works on establishing **standardized benchmark strategies** for quantum processors:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}, emphasizing that benchmarks should be fair, holistic, and hardware-agnostic. In these studies, he examined how optimizations (like dynamic decoupling and error mitigation) should be reported in metrics such as Quantum Volume:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}. Mirko also explores **error mitigation and correction** methods that can be deployed in the near term. For example, his research on **mirror benchmarking** and **application-oriented benchmarks** provides guidelines for assessing quantum advantage in practical scenarios. By combining error mitigation with careful benchmarking, Mirko aims to bridge the gap between noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and fault-tolerant quantum computing. His ultimate goal is to enable dependable quantum computations for meaningful problem sizes by improving both the *hardware* (through control) and the *metrics* by which we gauge progress.
